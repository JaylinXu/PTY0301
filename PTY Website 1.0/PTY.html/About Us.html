      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>We are PTY, our group formed on June 7, 2022. We came together because of our joint interests. We all love K-pop groups and covered four dances in half a year. The number of members in our team is not fixed. Currently, ten members have participated in a dance cover shoot. We usually cover the dances of popular KPOP groups, such as BTS and STRAY KIDS. </p>

      <h2>The Origin of the Name</h2>
      <p>PTY is the abbreviation of “葡萄柚（grapefruit）.” The name was happily decided during a casual conversation. It’s hard to define, but we wanted a playful name that suits our upbeat and energetic vibes. P stands for “Passion,” T stands for “Tomorrow,” and Y stands for “Youth.” We are young people who become more passionate and energetic every day. Such a label would make us more cohesive, but we don’t want to be limited by it. That’s why I say any single term cannot define us; we each bring our splash of colour to the group.

      <h2>Rehearsal</h2>
      <p>Usually, we decide on the dance we want to do and agree on a time to rehearse. We have a regular rehearsal space in a small yoga room in a condo, and we live close enough to have rehearsals at least once a week. The whole atmosphere during practices is upbeat and enjoyable for us. Before we shoot the video for the dance, we will communicate the dress code and try to match the theme as much as possible. Ultimately, we will edit the video before uploading it to various platforms, which makes us feel accomplished!
