        <h2>Roxanne</h2>
        <p>
          Rox has a strong charisma and always has a lingering fragrance around her. She also has a contrasting personality, talking less at first and seeming to have some sense of aloofness that is not to be messed with. But when you get to know her, you will find her funny.
